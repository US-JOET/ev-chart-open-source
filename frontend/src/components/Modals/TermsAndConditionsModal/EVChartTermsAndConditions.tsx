    <h4> Data Collection </h4>
    <div>
      The objectives of EV-ChART are to meet regulatory requirements in a streamlined and standardized fashion and
      integrate a set of reporting and analytic capabilities that fulfill the Office requirement in title VIII of
      division J of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (“BIL”) (enacted as the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act)
      (Pub. L. 117-58) (Nov. 15, 2021) to conduct “data sharing of installation, maintenance, and utilization in order
      to continue to inform the network build out of zero emission vehicle charging and refueling infrastructure…” 135
      Stat. 429, 1425. To support this requirement, EV-ChART facilitates the collection and storage of data on EV
      charging infrastructure funded under the NEVI Formula Program, as well as projects for the construction of
      publicly accessible EV chargers funded under Title 23, United States Code (“U.S.C.”), including an EV charging
      infrastructure project funded with Federal funds that is treated as a project on a Federal-aid highway. This
      collection includes data on charging station use, business participation, reliability, and cost information as
      described in 23 CFR 680.112
    </div>

    <h4> Data Use </h4>
    <div>
      Collected data are used to produce reports, conduct analysis, and conduct program monitoring, assessment, and
      future planning activities. The data will also be used to inform the network build out of zero emission vehicle
      charging and refueling infrastructure. EV-ChART also uses the data to provide a public-facing dashboard for
      communication of aggregated, anonymized information in accordance with part 680, to provide transparency and
      demonstrate effective use of Federal funds.
    </div>

    <h4> Data Sharing </h4>
    <div>
      DOE, U.S. DOT, and the Office will be able to view and download all EV charging infrastructure data submitted to
      EV-ChART. Designated contractors and DOE National Laboratories may also have access to the data as contractors
      supporting the Office's management and operation of EV-ChART.
    </div>
    <div>
      “DR” user accounts will only be able to provide access to data within their organization and/or contractors
      supporting their organization, and with the public (in alignment with the protection standards described above).
      “SR” user accounts will only be able to provide access to data that they themselves have submitted to EV-ChART.
    </div>
    <div>
      “JO” user accounts will be able to share the data within the Office, DOE and DOT, and with the public (in
      alignment with the protection standards described above). Using all the data submitted into EV-ChART, users under
      the “JO” account will be able to create a public-facing dashboard and publish reports on topics such as national
      EV charging reliability, grid-impacts, and equity.{" "}
      <b> Any data shared from a “JO” account with the public will first be aggregated and anonymized. </b>
    </div>

      comply with the audit, inspection, and copying requirements of the United States Government, or (vii) comply with
      relevant open records laws. We also may disclose your data as may be described in a notice to you at the time the
      information is collected, or in any other manner to which you consent. We will make reasonable efforts to inform
      you of how we are going to use your data. We will achieve this through these Terms of Use and by informing you how
      your data is used each time it is collected.

    </div>

    <h4> Rules of Behavior</h4>
    <div>By accepting this Terms of Use, I agree to the following:</div>
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I will not knowingly introduce any malicious code into the Office, DOE or DOT computer systems nor will I
          attempt to bypass or circumvent its security features.
        </li>
        <li>
          I will protect all passwords issued to me and will not disclose them to anyone. I will change my password
          immediately when I suspect that my password may have been compromised. I will not store any User-Id or
          Passwords in the Internet Explorer AutoComplete feature or in any file on my workstation.
        </li>
        <li>
          I will immediately notify the appropriate system administrator or other designated access control manager when
          I no longer require access to the Office, DOE or DOT systems because of transfer, completion of project,
          retirement, or termination of employment.
        </li>
        <li>
          I will protect sensitive unclassified information from unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, misuse,
          damage, or theft regardless of where it is processed or stored.
        </li>
        <li>
          I understand that as a user of the Office, DOE or DOT systems, I may have access to sensitive information
          including but not limited to passwords, PINs, financial account names/numbers and must protect that
          information from unauthorized disclosure. This includes not only securing information printed from the Office,
          DOE or DOT systems but ensuring that sensitive information displayed on my computer monitor is not visible to
          unauthorized individuals. I further understand that to protect sensitive information, I may have to locate my
          computer monitor or workstation screen away from doors, windows, or other openings in my work environment.
        </li>
        <li>
          I will not disclose confidential data obtained through the Office, DOE or DOT systems to anyone other than
          personnel who are authorized to view this data.
        </li>
        <li>
          I will not try to access systems or data to which access has not been authorized and I understand that I will
          be held accountable for my actions on the Office, DOE or DOT systems.
        </li>
        <li>
          I will immediately notify the Office and appropriate system owner of any security incident or violation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Personnel accessing social media/networking sites from organizational information systems will ensure that no
          confidential data/information obtained through the Office, DOE or DOT application will be shared external to
          the organization.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div>
        Federal law provides for punishment consisting of a fine under Title 18, U.S. Code and up to 10 years in jail
        for intentionally accessing a government information system without authorization, and altering, damaging, or
        destroying information, or preventing authorized use of the system.
